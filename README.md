## Abandon hope all ye who enter here



If you've come here hoping to hack on the Whirled server and improve it for fun and profit, then

beware that Whirled is a many tentacled beast with more moving parts than a stadium-sized Rube

Goldberg machine. Moreover, it was unceremoniously yanked from its crufty ancestral home to rescue

it from destruction.



It would take many tens of thousands of dollars to pay someone with the sufficient level of

expertise to clean it up and make it easy for normal humans to hack on and improve. We don't have

the time or money to do that, so you're stuck with what you see here. A complex, tempermental

project that uses half a dozen major technologies to do hundreds of barely related things.



If you're not **very** proficient in [Java], [JDBC] and [servlets], reasonably proficient in

[ActionScript] and [Flex], familiar with [GWT], and familiar with either [Postgres] or [MySQL],

then you're going to have a long hard road in front of you.



Good luck!



## Building



The code is built with the [Ant] build tool. The main build target is `distall`, invoked like so:



```

ant distall

```



There are a number of intermediate build targets that are useful when iterating on individual parts

of the project, those can be seen by running `ant -p`:



```

% ant -p

Buildfile: .../msoy/build.xml



Main targets:



 asclient      Builds the Flash world client.

 clean         Cleans out compiled code.

 compile       Builds java class files.

 distall       Builds entire system (does not package).

 distcleanall  Fully cleans out the application and all subprojects.

 flashapps     Builds all Flash clients and applets.

 gclients      Builds all GWT clients (use -Dpages to choose which).

 genasync      Regenerates GWT Async interfaces.

 package       Builds entire system and generates dpkg files.

 tests         Runs unit tests.

 thane-client  Builds the thane game client.

 viewer        Build the viewer for the SDK.

Default target: compile

```



## Running a test instance



It is possible to run a test instance of the Whirled server on a developer machine. A variety of

configuration files must be copied into place and configured. The following files:



```

etc/build_settings.properties.dist

etc/burl-server.conf.dist

etc/burl-server.properties.dist

etc/msoy-server.conf.dist

etc/msoy-server.properties.dist

```



must be copied to:



```

etc/test/build_settings.properties

etc/test/burl-server.conf

etc/test/burl-server.properties

etc/test/msoy-server.conf

etc/test/msoy-server.properties

```



and edited to reflect the configuration of your local instance. The `.dist` config files contain

comments explaining each of the configurations. The most important configuration is for a local

database server (either MySQL or Postgres) which the Whirled server will use to store data.



Assuming you have successfully run `ant distall` to build the server and client, and you have

put the configuration files in place, and your database server is properly configured and running,

you can run the local Whirled instance like so:



```

./bin/msoyserver

```



This will report log messages to the console indicating the status of the running server. If you

see something like the following, then you're in good shape:



```

```



You can then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to access your local Whirled instance.
